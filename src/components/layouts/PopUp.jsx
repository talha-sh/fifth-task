              Dear Concerned, <br/>Iâ€™m currently working full-time on a product with
              a very tight client deadline, which often requires late sittings
              and weekend work. Because of this, I couldnâ€™t find enough time to
              complete the task properly. I managed to do a basic version in the
              2â€“3 hours I had, just to honor the commitment and avoid missing
              the submission. This is not a complete reflection of my skills â€”
              you can better judge those through my past projects or in an
              interview.
            </p>
